# Babel Markdown

# Babel Markdown is a VS Code extension that renders Markdown files through a Babel-powered transformation pipeline before displaying them inside a preview webview. This repository is initialized with a clean TypeScript setup, testing scaffold, and opinionated linting so you can focus on feature work.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```
3. Launch the extension host (Run Extension configuration) and start iterating.

```

## Scripts

- `npm run compile` – Type-checks and emits the extension into `dist/`.
- `npm run watch` – Incremental compilation while you edit.
- `npm run compile-tests` – Builds the test workspace into `dist-test/`.
- `npm run test` – Runs the compiled test suite through `@vscode/test-electron`.
- `npm run lint` – Lints the codebase with ESLint.
- `npm run check` – Convenience script that lints and tests.

## Next Steps

- Flesh out `BabelMarkdownService` with real transformation logic.
- Implement a custom webview panel UI for rendering Markdown alongside raw source.
- Add integration tests that exercise the preview panel and command flow.

Happy hacking!
